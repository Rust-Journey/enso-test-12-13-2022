# Intoduction
Hi! If you read this, it means that your application have been selected and advanced to the next
stage of the Senior Rust Developer recruitment process in Enso. We send this document to
approximately 5% of all applicants, and we are really happy to have you here. From all solutions
we get, we will select every solution which meets our code quality standards and will schedule a
final call with their authors. The call is the last step in the process and we are
looking forward to having you on this call! :)

The tasks presented here are simple and should not be very time consuming. We understand
that even simple tasks require time to deeply analyze the performance / security implications of
alternative solutions. We want you to always choose the best solution and clearly justify your
choices to us.

When solving the following tasks, please follow these rules:
- The code should be of a production ready quality. It should be a code, which you would be
proud to create a pull request for. In particular, remember about documentation, linting,
proper semantic naming, and keeping the API clean and understandable.
- Please take all security, performance, and memory usage conserns into consideration and
write about them in a comment at the end of each file with a particular solution. Create a
public API which could be easily and securely consumed by the end user.
- Please use Rust formatter, lint your code, and apply all standard good code quality practices.
