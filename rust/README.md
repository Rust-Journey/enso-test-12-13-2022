# Rust

Hi! If you're reading this, it means that your application has been selected and advanced to the next
stage of the Senior Rust Developer recruitment process at Enso. We send this document to
approximately 5% of all applicants, and we're really happy to have you here!

For each of the solutions that we get that meets our code quality standards we will schedule a final
call with the author. This call is the last step in the recruitment process, and we're excited to
talking to you there!

The tasks presented here are simple, and should nto be very time consuming. We understand that even
simple tasks require time to deeply analyze the performance and security implications of potential
solutions. We would like you to always choose the best solution, and clearly justify your choices
to us.

When working on the following tasks, please follow these rules:

- The code should be of a production ready quality. It should be code which you would be proud to
  create a pull request for. In particular, remember about documentation, linting, proper semantic
  naming, and keeping the API clean and understandable.
- Please take all security, performance, and memory usage concerns into consideration and write
  about them in a comment at the end of the file for each solution. Create a public API which could
  be easily and securely consumed by and end user.
- Please use the Rust formatter (`rustfmt`), lint your code, and apply practices for good code
  quality.
